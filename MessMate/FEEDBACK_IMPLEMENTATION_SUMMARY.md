## API Endpoints Used

The implementation leverages existing backend API endpoints:

- `GET /api/feedback/all` - Fetch all feedback
- `GET /api/feedback/{id}` - Get specific feedback details
- `GET /api/feedback/rating/{rating}` - Filter by rating
- `GET /api/feedback/stats/pending-count` - Get pending count
- `PUT /api/feedback/{id}/status` - Update feedback status
- `POST /api/feedback/{id}/reply` - Add staff reply

## Features Implemented

### Admin Features
1. **View All Feedback** - Complete list with pagination-ready design
2. **Filter Feedback** - By rating (1-5 stars) and date
3. **Status Management** - Update feedback status workflow
4. **Reply to Feedback** - Direct communication with students
5. **Statistics Dashboard** - Real-time metrics and averages
6. **Export Ready** - Structure supports future export functionality

### Staff Features
1. **View Feedback List** - Clean, organized feedback display
2. **Detailed View Modal** - Click to expand feedback details
3. **Reply System** - Respond to student concerns
4. **Status Updates** - Mark as read, reviewed, resolved
5. **Filter Options** - By rating and status
6. **Pending Count** - Track unresolved feedback

### Student Experience (Backend Ready)
- Students can submit feedback via existing API
- Feedback is properly stored with user relationships
- Students can view their feedback history
- Receive staff replies and status updates

## Database Schema Support

The implementation works with the existing Feedback entity:
- **student_id** - Links to User table
- **feedback_type** - FOOD_QUALITY, SERVICE, CLEANLINESS, GENERAL, COMPLAINT, SUGGESTION
- **rating** - 1-5 star rating system
- **message** - Student feedback text
- **status** - PENDING, REVIEWED, RESOLVED, DISMISSED
- **staff_reply** - Staff response text
- **replied_by** - Staff member who replied
- **timestamps** - Created and updated times

## How to Test

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   cd MessMate
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Access Dashboards**
   - Admin: `http://localhost:8080/admin-dashboard.html`
   - Staff: `http://localhost:8080/staff-dashboard.html`

3. **Login Credentials** (from sample data)
   - Admin: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
   - Staff: `staff@example.com` / `password123`
   - Student: `test@example.com` / `password123`

4. **Test Features**
   - Navigate to Feedback section in admin/staff dashboard
   - View sample feedback data
   - Test filtering by rating and date
   - Try replying to feedback
   - Update feedback status
   - Check statistics updates

## Technical Improvements
